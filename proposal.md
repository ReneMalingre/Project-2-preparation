## My Ideas

## ðŸ’¡Informational Fact Sheet Generator - *InfoPulse*

### User: Health Clinic/Consultant/Personal Services/Etc business needing to give out information or instructions to clients on demand

40-80% of advice given to clients is forgotten immediately. Information in written form helps to clarify and reinforce important messages and advice and instructions. Paper leaflets are sometimes provided, but it is a burden to keep these up-to-date and printed in the appropriate quantity to ensure they are on hand and that money is not wasted on printing. There can be a reluctance to give them out if the patient or client believes they can remember what was said, in a normal over-estimation of their own ability to recall information. Sometimes more personal information or clarifications/extensions of information are required, and this is often done by hand or by email, which is time-consuming and inefficient.

#### âœ…Proposal

Using a web-based form to select from a list of pre-written fact sheets, with the option to add custom information, will generate a HTML page dynamically that can either be viewed online through a login or (extension to MVP) sent via an HTML email directly to the patient.

- Eg: You are myopic â€“ here are some facts
- Everything is fine: see you in two years unless you have problems
- Here is how to clean your eyelash line to avoid infection and improve your dry-eye
- Thanks for visiting: here is some information about your visit and your practitioner, and when you should return.
- Suggest fact sheets are edited in markdown and use an npm package to convert it to html.
- Ability to add images to the fact sheets to enhance the information.

### Design Elements

#### Font

#### Color Scheme

Healthcare and medical services often use blue tones for their calming, professional, and trustworthy associations. Here are a few color combinations:

Classic Medical Palette:

Light Blue (#5698C6)
Dark Blue (#31557F)
White (#FFFFFF)
Light Grey (#F2F2F2)
Viridian (#4A7C59)
Dark Grey (#333333)

utilize this color palette for various elements of the website:

Background: Light Grey (#F2F2F2) for the website's main background color. This color is light and neutral, which makes it perfect for a background color.

Navigation Bar / Footer: Use Dark Blue (#31557F) for the navigation bar and footer. Dark colors are often used for these sections to provide a solid base.

Buttons / Links / CTAs: Light Blue (#5698C6) could be used for clickable elements such as buttons, links, or Call to Actions (CTAs). This color will stand out against the other colors, drawing the user's attention.

Text: For primary text, you can use Dark Blue (#31557F) and Dark Grey (#333333) to ensure readability. White (#FFFFFF) can be used for text on darker backgrounds (like on buttons, navigation bar).

Highlights / Accents: Viridian (#4A7C59) can be used as an accent color for highlights, icons, or to draw attention to specific areas.

Borders / Dividers / Shadows: Light Blue (#5698C6) and Viridian (#4A7C59) can be used for borders, dividers, or shadows, creating depth and definition.
